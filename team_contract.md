# Team Working Contract

Below is a teamwork contract template adapted from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/teach/instructionalstrategies/groupprojects/tools/index.html).
It is divided into several sections, and it is expected that each group will spend some time generating at least 5 points for each section that **everyone agrees** to. 

If you are not able to agree on these points, it is a sign that your group may become dysfunctional, and you should seek advice from me (the course instructor) ASAP to resolve and mediate the discussion.

## Team Members

## Participation

All team members agree to fully participate in all aspects of the project.
To accomplish this goal, below are five concrete actions that we all agree to take:

1. Check the repo twice weekly
2. Weekly lab meetings for decision making
3. Approve pull request collaboratively within a couple days
4. Keep Sections separate


## Communication

All team members agree to communicate openly and transparently during the project.
To accomplish this goal, below are five concrete actions that we all agree to take:

1. Slack for communication
2. Communicate as needed
3. Always inform of updates


## Meetings

All team members agree to meet regularly during the project.
To accomplish this goal, below are five concrete ideas that we all agree to regarding scheduling and frequency of meetings:

1. Setup additional meeting as necessary

## Conduct

The code of conduct we have chosen is in the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) document.
All team members agree to following the code of conduct, and below are five concrete escalation steps that we all agree to follow in the event that the code of conduct is violated by any member of the group (Step 1 is the first thing you will do, and Step 5 is the last thing you will do).

1. Talk to the person
2. Consult the group
3. Talk to TA
4. Talk to Professor
5. Talk to Head of Department


*N.B. Please do not hesitate to expand beyond 5 steps if needed.*

## Conflict Management

Despite our best intentions, conflict may invariably arise within teammates.
Discuss amongst your team some conflict mitigation strategies (feel free to search online if needed) and come up with 5 strategies all members of the team agree to follow in the event there is a conflict within the group.
You may also include things you will NOT do in the event a conflict arises.

1. Be open to all perspectives
2. Be open to learning from each group member
3. Don't slander team members
4. No personal attacks
5. Verbally demonstrate understanding of different perspectives
6. No tantrums


## Deadlines

All team members agree to the following conventions around course deadlines:

1. Make every effort to meet original deadlines
2. Express difficulties in meeting deadlines


...etc...

*N.B. 

## Git Workflow

There are many git workflows possible when working on a team project with many moving parts.
I suggest you discuss in your group some possible Git workflows.
[Here is a brief primer on some common options](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows).
I suggest reading them, understanding them, and then selecting one.
You can explore and choose any you like, but if you cannot decide, I suggest using the "Feature Branch Workflow".


All team members agree to the [Name of chosen Git Workflow] workflow, and the following conventions (e.g., master branch protection, at least X reviews before a pull request, at least N days before the deadline etc...):

1. Feature-branch-workflow
