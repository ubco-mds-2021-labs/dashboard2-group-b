#Work Achieved

Our team implemented everything as planned. Our primary objective is to provide analytical insights, visually, for ease of use in cases such as the determination of the adequate photovoltaic and energy storage size.

After implementations using Python and R, we decided to remain with R. This resulted in various modifications that are geared towards optimization and clean design. For example, we changed our the design of our layout from what we presented initially.

Since the dashboard is implemented in R, certain elements of the presente layout which have been modified in comparison to the initial layout to add more grace to the dashboard. We have successfully implemented on reducing the viewer`s pain to search and select from the dropdown by hovers over the particular floor and conveniently select the room to view the details. 
All the plots are interactive and functional as per the dropdowns and selection menu insertions in the dashboard. The principle of visualizations have been kept in mind. We believe that the layout has been perfectly performed and is functional as per our decision making. 

#Work not yet achieved

Every component is dynamic as per the selection made by the user.

#Positive Reflections

The plots are interactive as we wanted them to be. The presented information seems to be perfectly aligned to convey our message. The segmentation of the plots is well achieved as per the importance of message that viewer should focus on while doing the visualization. It was a wonderful experience to deploy the app in the R language though it was a bit of time consuming as compared to Python and a bit of pain, but the members patience and efforts helped in achieving the required task. We have now included our interactive floor plan image and modified the plots to convey more information in a presentable form. 

#Negative Reflections

Our dashboard is as we had planned. We believe that there are no negative reflections of our dashboard. The purpose is environmentally and emotionally safe.

#TAs Feedback

We will be suggested to work on our plot and modify the chart type for few of them. Additionally, instructor directed us to work on how we could modify few of our plots as they were communicating duplicate information.
