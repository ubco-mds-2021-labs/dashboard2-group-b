#Work Achieved
The team has implemented everything as planned. Since the dashboard is implemented in R; there are certain elements of the presented layout which have been modified as required in order to add more grace to the dashboard. All the plots required by the team have been made. All the plots are interactive and functional as per the dropdowns and selection menu insertions in the dashboard. The message that we were willing to convey has been achieved by the team. The position of the elements have been perfectly performed and has been made function as we required from them. The positions of the plots have been modified to give a dashboard a better view. We have incorporated most of the useful information we have planned to present to our viewer.

#Work not yet achieved

Currently, the plots would interact using dropdown for the room selection and the date selection but later on we will change the interaction through the floor plan image as presented in our layout in the milestone1. There would be some changes in relation to the layout and the plot with regards to the principles of visualization. A piece that we have not yet worked on is the proper presentation/beautification of our dashboard.

#Not Functional Components

Every component is dynamic as per the selection made by the user.

#Positive Reflections

The plots are interactive as we wanted them to be. The presented information seems to be perfectly aligned to convey our message. The segmentation of the plots is well achieved as per the importance of message that viewer should focus on while doing the visualization. It was a wonderful experience to deploy the app in the R language though it was a bit of time consuming as compared to Python and a bit of pain, but the members patience and efforts helped in achieving the required task.

#Negative Reflections

We think that the principle of visualizations need to be incorporated.

#Future Scope of improvement

We would now get our floor plan image come in as a master piece and present more information to the view in a concise manner. We would reduce viewer`s pain to search and select from the dropdown by hovers over the particular floor and conveniently select the room to view the details. Focus will be visualization principles and more professional presentation.
