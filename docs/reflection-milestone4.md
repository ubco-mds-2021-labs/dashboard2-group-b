#Work Achieved

As a team we made changes to our orignial plans as needed and according to insightful feedback. For example, we changed our the design of our layout from what we presented initially in order to obtain cleaner styles. Our design now include 3 tabs, less interactive graphs, and an interactive floor plan.

Initially, we coded  in two languages, Python and R, and deployed our app for each. For our final version, we decided to remain with R for its inherent optimization advantage with graphical visualizations. 
 

#Work not yet achieved

We successfully completed all objectives in this milestone. 

#Positive Reflections

The plots are interactive as we wanted them to be. The presented information seems to be perfectly aligned to convey our message. The segmentation of the plots is well achieved as per the importance of message that viewer should focus on while doing the visualization. It was a wonderful experience to deploy the app in the R language though it was a bit more time consuming as compared to Python and a bit of pain, but each member's patience and effort helped to overcome these challenges. We have now included our interactive floor plan image and modified the plots to convey more information in a presentable form. 

#Negative Reflections

None.

#TAs Feedback

Our TA suggested that we work on our plots and modify the chart types of a few of them. Additionally, our instructor provided insights on how we could modify some of our plots in order to remove duplicate information.
