#Work Achieved

As a team we made changes to our orignial plans as needed and according to insightful feedback. For example, we changed our the design of our layout from what we presented initially in order to obtain cleaner styles. Our design now include 3 tabs, less interactive graphs, and an interactive floor plan.

Initially, we coded  in two languages, Python and R, and deployed our app for each. For our final version, we decided to remain with R for its inherent optimization advantage with graphical visualizations. 
 

#Work not yet achieved

Every component is dynamic as per the selection made by the user.

#Positive Reflections

The plots are interactive as we wanted them to be. The presented information seems to be perfectly aligned to convey our message. The segmentation of the plots is well achieved as per the importance of message that viewer should focus on while doing the visualization. It was a wonderful experience to deploy the app in the R language though it was a bit of time consuming as compared to Python and a bit of pain, but the members patience and efforts helped in achieving the required task. We have now included our interactive floor plan image and modified the plots to convey more information in a presentable form. 

#Negative Reflections

Our dashboard is as we had planned. We believe that there are no negative reflections of our dashboard. The purpose is environmentally and emotionally safe.

#TAs Feedback

We will be suggested to work on our plot and modify the chart type for few of them. Additionally, instructor directed us to work on how we could modify few of our plots as they were communicating duplicate information.
