## Final Reflection on Workload Distribution

** This section should be completed AFTER Milestone 4 is done and submitted! Only one is needed PER group. **

In this section we will ask you to self-report the workload distribution to various categories of tasks.
For each of the categories, we want you to report the approximate workload distribution, split by the milestone.

Here are the tables you are expected to complete (the first one is pre-filled in so you can see what we're expecting):

### Milestone 1

| Category           | Team member 1 | Team member 2 | Team member 3 | Team member 4 |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Repository Setup   | 60%           | 40%           | -             | -             |
| Sketch             | 20%           | 25%           | 25%           | 30%           |
| Documentation      | 10%           | 10%           | 40%           | 40%           |
| Project Management | 50%           | 50%           | 0%            | 0%            |
| Troubleshooting    | -             | -             | -             | -             |

Brief notes/explanations (optional):
- No troubleshooting was needed for Milestone 1
- Member 1 and Member did most of the repository setup, whereas 3 and 4 did most of the documentation
